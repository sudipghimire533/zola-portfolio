I found my head start in IT field when I was at school in year 2018 and beside the strong foundational knowledge I recived from my school teachers, I tough myself to program and to build real things. I contunied my self learning after school, Joined intenships, Started freelancing, Done projects and I now see better things ahead of me.

I would like to remember the hands that raised me, friends who kept me falling, family relatives who made it possible to keep myself going and everyone who prayed from me. I really feel blessed remembering you guys <i class='fas fa-heart text-pink-500'></i>
